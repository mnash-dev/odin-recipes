        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <h5>Pork Chops</h5>
                    <li>4 pork chops</li>
                    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil like avocado oil or vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <h5>Pan Sauce</h5>
                    <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken stock</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons honey or brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, optional</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt. 
                    Set the chops aside to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the spice rub. In a small bowl, mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, 
                    onion powder, smoked paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.</li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to dry the pork chops, then rub both sides of the chops with the spice rub.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a skillet (with a lid) over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and looks shimmery, 
                    add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
                    <p>Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. If there is a fattier side of the pork, use kitchen 
                        tongs to hold the chops fat-side-down until they sizzle and brown slightly, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low, then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook for 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read 
                    thermometer reads 145Â°F when inserted into the thickest part of the chop. Cook time depends on the thickness 
                    of the chops, so check for doneness at 5 minutes, then go from there, checking every 2 minutes after that. If 
                    you do not have a thermometer, pork chops are done if, when cutting into them, the juices run clear.</li>
                <li>Transfer pork chops to a plate, then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <h5>Make Pan Sauce</h5>
                <li>While the pork chops rest, make the pan sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the chicken 
                    stock, vinegar, and honey.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. As it simmers, use a wooden spoon to scrape the 
                    bottom of the pan so that any stuck bits of pork come up.</li>
                <li>Taste, then adjust with additional salt, vinegar, or honey.</li>    
                <li>Slide the skillet off the heat, wait until the sauce stops simmering, then swirl in the butter.</li>
                <li>Slide the pork chops back into the pan and spoon some of the sauce over them. You can also slice the chops 
                    and place them back into the pan.</li>
                <li>Scatter fresh parsley over the pork, and then serve.</li>
            </ol>
